## [unreleased] — 2026-05-17 — GarmentVision recovery

Backend-only recovery patch following the 16 May `AddItem.jsx` regression
(reverted to commit `fe45ba9`). Eight surgical fixes to `garment_vision.py`
and `clothing_parser.py` that restored and hardened the AddItem pipeline:

- **Mask alignment** — SegFormer mask sliced from the exact `box_px` the JPEG
  was cut at; no more 5 % shift on asymmetric-padding categories.
- **Phantom guard** — `_matte_crops` drops detections whose final RGBA
  solid-alpha coverage is `< 5 %`. No more empty white cards in the closet.
- **Same-class spatial split** — two layered tops in one SegFormer bbox
  emerge as two detections via connected-component analysis.
- **Human-mask subtraction + geometric head-exclusion** — face / hair /
  limbs no longer leak into top, outerwear, or dress crops.
- **Category-aware percentage short-edge floor** — replaces the old
  absolute-pixel floor; shoes / belts / accessories survive at 8 % of
  source short edge regardless of upload resolution.
- **Mask-fragment bridging** — bag body + strap re-join into one
  detection via morphological closing + convex-hull bridging.
- **Category-aware cap ordering** — `_filter_useful_detections` guarantees
  one item per kind survives before filling remaining slots by area.
- **`_fit_crop_to_card`** — every emitted `crop_base64` is scaled to fit
  a 900×1200 (3:4 portrait) canvas (always preserves aspect, no clipping)
  and centered. RGBA → transparent PNG; RGB → white-padded JPEG. Applied
  at all 5 base64-emit sites in `garment_vision.py` so Camera, Single,
  Batch, streaming and one-pass paths render uniformly.

Two new reference documents accompany this release:
- `docs/GarmentVision.md` — full pipeline reference (stages, models,
  config flags, failure modes, code locations).
- `docs/GarmentVisionWaste.md` — the chronicle of the 16 May regression
  and its recovery, with a timeline / prompt / action table.

Frontend (`AddItem.jsx`, etc.) and `CONCRETE_FACTS.md` were intentionally
untouched per user guardrail.

## [v1.1.0] — 2026-05-02

Marketplace Wave 2 (Swap + Donate pipelines) and Wave 3 (listing-level
shipping fee, transactions UI, APP_PUBLIC_URL hygiene) rolled up into a
single stable release. No breaking changes vs `v1.0-stable`; every new
field defaults to zero/false so existing rows remain valid without
migration. This tag is also the pre-swap checkpoint before the upcoming
Phase O Stylist provider migration (Gemini → Qwen-VL → Gemma4-E4B).

Highlights:
- **Wave 2** — Swap + Donate pipelines with JWT-signed email accept/deny,
  confirm-receipt flow, auth-optional transaction landing page, and
  mode-aware listing detail CTAs.
- **Wave 3** — Optional `Listing.shipping_fee_cents` (free by default)
  with community-pickup nudges baked into the UI copy, PayPal capture
  for donation shipping reimbursement, full Transactions page rewrite
  (kind tabs + status chips + inline confirm-receipt), and auto-derived
  `APP_PUBLIC_URL` for preview/staging pods.

Full details in the two sections below.

---

## [v1.1.0 changes, part 1] — Marketplace Wave 3

### Added
- **Listing-level shipping fee** (`Listing.shipping_fee_cents`). Optional,
  defaults to 0 (local-pickup only), and applies uniformly across sell,
  swap, and donate modes. DressApp's environmental ethos is expressed
  directly in the UI: listings without a shipping fee advertise
  "🌱 Local pickup preferred — no shipping fee", and listings with a
  fee pair it with "Or meet locally to skip the fee 🌱" messaging.
- **PayPal capture for donation shipping**. When a donate listing sets
  `shipping_fee_cents > 0`, claimers pay that amount via PayPal:
  - `POST /api/v1/transactions/donate` creates a PayPal order instead
    of emailing the donor.
  - `POST /api/v1/transactions/donate/{tx_id}/capture?order_id=…`
    finalises the capture and only then fires the donor's JWT-signed
    accept/deny email.
  - Frontend reuses `PayPalCheckoutButton` for consistent checkout UX
    across buy and donation-shipping flows.
- **Transactions page rewrite**. `/transactions` now features:
  - Primary tabs by transaction kind (All / Buying / Selling / Swaps /
    Donations), each with a live count badge.
  - Secondary multi-select status chips (pending / accepted / denied /
    shipped / completed / paid / refunded).
  - Per-row kind-appropriate icons, status tone, and an inline
    "Confirm receipt" button for accepted swap + donate rows belonging
    to the current user.
- **Create Listing form** adds a shipping-fee input with community-first
  helper copy pushing users toward local pickup.
- **`APP_PUBLIC_URL` auto-derive**. When the env var is unset, the
  backend now derives the public origin from `X-Forwarded-Proto` +
  `X-Forwarded-Host` (or `Host`) on the inbound request, so preview
  and staging pods build correct email links without per-env
  configuration. Explicit `APP_PUBLIC_URL` still wins when set. A new
  `backend/.env.example` documents every environment variable the
  backend reads, including the precedence rules for this one.

### Changed
- `payments.py::listing_buy_create` now adds `listing.shipping_fee_cents`
  on top of `list_price_cents` when creating the PayPal order. The
  returned payload breaks `list_price_cents`, `shipping_fee_cents`,
  and `amount_cents` apart so the frontend can render a clean line-
  item preview. Seller-side fee math remains computed on the item
  price only (shipping is pass-through).
- `transactions.py` endpoints that emit outbound URLs (`/action`,
  `/swap`, `/donate`, `/donate/{id}/capture`) now accept the FastAPI
  `Request` so `_action_url` and `_landing_redirect` can auto-derive
  the correct origin.

### Deprecated
- `DonateClaimIn.handling_fee_cents` — donations are always free per
  DressApp's environmental ethos. The field is still accepted by the
  endpoint for backwards compatibility but is ignored server-side;
  shipping fees are now driven by `listing.shipping_fee_cents`.

### API / endpoints added
- `POST /api/v1/transactions/donate/{tx_id}/capture?order_id=…`

### Frontend api.js additions
- `api.captureDonationShipping(txId, orderId)`

---

## [v1.1.0 changes, part 2] — Marketplace Wave 2

### Added
- **Swap pipeline**. Users can propose a swap directly from a listing:
  - New `POST /api/v1/transactions/swap` creates a zero-cash transaction
    linking the swapper's offered closet item to the lister's listing.
  - `SwapPickerModal` frontend component (Shadcn Dialog) lets the user
    browse their own closet and pick one item to offer.
- **Donation flow**. New `POST /api/v1/transactions/donate` endpoint plus
  one-click "Claim this donation" CTA on `mode=donate` listings. Handling
  fee is sent to the backend as metadata; PayPal handling-fee capture is
  deferred to a follow-up iteration.
- **JWT-signed email accept/deny**. New `services/action_tokens.py` mints
  short-lived JWTs (7-day expiry) with a dedicated `aud="dressapp.tx_action"`
  claim so they cannot be replayed against auth endpoints. Each token
  carries a random `jti` that is persisted on the transaction and spent
  exactly once — reuse and tampering both fail gracefully.
- **Public action endpoint** `GET /api/v1/transactions/action?token=…&decision=…`
  verifies the JWT, applies accept/deny idempotently, fires follow-up
  emails (`swap_success` / `swap_denied` / `donation_both`), and 303-
  redirects the browser to the transaction landing page.
- **Transaction landing page** at `/transactions/:id/landing` (auth-optional
  so email clicks from logged-out browsers still work). Renders a status
  banner (Accepted / Declined / Pending / Expired), listing summary with
  size + condition + description, and a Back-to-Marketplace CTA. Backed
  by a minimal public projection via `GET /transactions/:id/landing-summary`.
- **Confirm-receipt endpoint** `POST /api/v1/transactions/:id/confirm-receipt`.
  Both parties can mark the incoming item as received; when both have
  confirmed, the swap completes, closet ownership flips, and listings
  close.
- **Listing detail enrichment** on `/market/:id`:
  - Always-visible badges for Size, Condition, Category, and Mode.
  - Always-visible Description block.
  - Mode-aware primary CTA — Buy / Swap / Donate — with self-swap and
    self-donate hidden when the listing is owned by the viewer.

### Changed
- `Transaction` schema gained a `kind` discriminator ("buy" | "swap" |
  "donate") plus nested `swap` and `donate` sub-documents. Legacy `buy`
  transactions are untouched (default remains `kind="buy"`).
- `TxStatus` literal extended with `accepted`, `denied`, `shipped`,
  `completed` — drives the new swap + donate state machine without
  breaking reads of older buy ledger rows.
- `transactions.paypal.order_id` index migrated from `sparse=True` (which
  still indexes explicit nulls) to a `partialFilterExpression` that only
  covers string values. Prevents duplicate-key 500s when swap/donate
  transactions — which never touch PayPal — insert with a null
  `paypal.order_id`.

### API / endpoints added
- `POST /api/v1/transactions/swap`
- `POST /api/v1/transactions/donate`
- `GET  /api/v1/transactions/action`
- `POST /api/v1/transactions/:id/confirm-receipt`
- `GET  /api/v1/transactions/:id/landing-summary` (public)

### Frontend api.js additions
- `api.proposeSwap(listingId, offeredItemId)`
- `api.claimDonation(listingId, handlingFeeCents)`
- `api.confirmReceipt(txId)`
- `api.getLandingSummary(txId)` (unauthenticated)

## [v1.0-stable] — 2026-05-01

First stable milestone shipped to production (https://dressapp.co) on Hetzner
with Atlas M10. Contest-ready build.

### Added
- **Phase Z2 — Pre-flight duplicate detection**. Client computes SHA-256 +
  perceptual (aHash) hashes in-browser on file select. `POST /closet/preflight`
  returns matches against the user's closet BEFORE any SegFormer / rembg /
  Gemini analyze cost is paid. Users can skip duplicates or explicitly
  "Add anyway" (red ⭐ overlay on card).
- **Star auto-demotion on delete**. When a closet item is deleted, the
  remaining fingerprint group is inspected; if only starred copies survive,
  the oldest is promoted back to "original" (`is_duplicate=false`).
- **DressApp logo lockup**. Full favicon set (16/32/48/180/192/512 + `.ico`),
  PWA manifest icons, Apple touch icon. New shared `<BrandLogo>` component
  placed in the login editorial panel, login mobile header, and TopNav.
- **Search bar polish** on Closet:
  - Debounced live-search (~300 ms) for keyword mode — no need to hit Enter.
  - Clear (X) button inside the search input when the field has text.
  - Active-state accent ring on Category / Source selects when their value
    is non-default.
- **Category filter synonym map** — backend `list_items` now matches
  `shoes ↔ Footwear`, `accessory ↔ Accessories`, `dress ↔ Full Body`,
  `top ↔ Top/tops`, etc., case-insensitively. Fixes long-standing bug where
  filters returned 0 items because legacy rows used different labels.
- **Verification markers** on `GET /api/v1/closet/analyze/version`:
  `preflight_duplicate_v1`, `legacy_post_analyze_dup_removed`,
  `category_synonyms_v1` — all return `true` when the correct build is
  deployed.

### Changed
- **Stylist Brain** (`outfit_composer.py`, `stylist_memory.py`) now excludes
  `is_duplicate=true` items from outfit suggestions.
- **`/closet/analyze`** no longer invokes `find_potential_duplicate`. The
  post-analysis attribute matcher is permanently disabled — pre-flight is
  now the sole duplicate gate. The response field `potential_duplicate` is
  always `null` (kept for back-compat with older frontend bundles).

### Fixed
- **Production deploy unblocked**: `protobuf==7.34.1 → 5.29.6` in
  `backend/requirements.txt` to resolve `grpcio-status <6.0dev` conflict
  that was failing fresh Docker builds on Hetzner.
- **Atlas quota crisis recovery** — identified 509 MB of `segmented_image_url`
  data URLs inflating MongoDB past the M0 512 MB ceiling; upgraded to M10
  (10 GB) to restore writes. (Object-storage migration still pending — see
  roadmap.)
- Hetzner `Dockerfile.backend` now passes `--extra-index-url` for
  `emergentintegrations` during pip install.

### Infrastructure
- **Preview pod DB name**: `backend/.env` set to `DB_NAME="test_database"` so
  the dev user's 113-item closet is reachable on the preview pod. Production
  Atlas `.env` is unaffected (`DB_NAME="dressapp"`).

### Known issues / deferred
- ~500 MB of inline base64 image data still sits in Atlas `closet_items`.
  M10 tier provides comfortable headroom; proper migration to object storage
  (Cloudflare R2 or Antigravity integration) is deferred to v1.1.
- `AddItem.jsx` is > 1800 lines and overdue for refactor (tracked for v1.2+).

## [Unreleased]

### Added — Phase O Wave 1: Stylist brain swap (Gemini → Qwen-VL-Max)
- New `app/services/qwen_client.py` — async `httpx`-based client for
  Alibaba DashScope's multimodal generation API. Handles base64 image
  data URIs, JSON response mode, connection retry/backoff, and a
  hard timeout that stays inside the preview gateway ceiling.
- New `app/services/stylist_brain.py` — provider abstraction with
  `QwenStylistBrain` (primary), `GeminiStylistBrain` (fallback adapter
  around the legacy service), and a `FallbackBrain` wrapper that
  silently falls back to the secondary provider on `QwenError` /
  `RuntimeError` / `TimeoutError`. A future `GemmaStylistBrain` will
  plug in here without touching callers.
- New env vars (see `backend/.env.example`):
  - `STYLIST_PROVIDER` (default `qwen`) — primary brain
  - `STYLIST_FALLBACK` (default `gemini`) — secondary brain
  - `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` — Singapore/International console key
  - `DASHSCOPE_BASE_URL` — defaults to `https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/api/v1`
  - `QWEN_BRAIN_MODEL` (default `qwen-vl-max-latest`)
  - `QWEN_EYES_MODEL` (default `qwen-vl-plus`, reserved for Wave O.2)

### Changed
- `services/logic.py::build_stylist_reply` now resolves the brain
  through `stylist_brain_service()` instead of calling
  `gemini_stylist_service` directly. Behaviour is identical when
  `STYLIST_PROVIDER=gemini`, so rollback is a one-line env change.
- Metric naming: `latency["gemini_ms"]` retained for dashboard
  compatibility — represents "time spent in the stylist brain", not
  necessarily Gemini.

### Upcoming (Wave O.2)
- Migrate `garment_vision` Eyes + Brain calls to Qwen-VL-Plus +
  Qwen-VL-Max-Latest.
- Slot the fine-tuned `Gemma4-E4B` model into the provider chain once
  a 24/7 host is available (HF Inference Endpoints / Modal / Runpod).
