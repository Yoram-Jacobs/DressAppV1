# DressApp Eyes — Hetzner deploy

Self-hosted FastAPI wrapper around the fine-tuned **Gemma-4 E2B**
GGUF (`gemma-4-e2b-it.Q4_K_M-002.gguf` + `gemma-4-e2b-it.BF16-mmproj.gguf`) used by
the DressApp closet pipeline. Replaces the Qwen-VL leg of
`backend/app/services/garment_vision.py` when `EYES_PROVIDER=gemma`.

> **No HuggingFace token, ever.** GGUF + mmproj artefacts are
> bind-mounted from a local directory on the VPS (see Section 2
> below). Read
> `quarantine/2026-05-sabotage/READ_THIS_FIRST.md` for the
> background — earlier versions of this README told you to set
> `EYES_HF_TOKEN` and download from a private HF repo. That was
> the sabotage line. **Don't reintroduce it.**

Runs as a sibling container next to `backend`, `frontend`, and `caddy`
in `deploy/docker-compose.yml`. Internal-only: backend reaches it at
`http://eyes:7860` over the `dress` Docker network — Caddy never
proxies it, so it's never publicly exposed.

Repo path on the VPS: `/srv/AI-Stylist/` (matches the GitHub repo
name; pre-existing deploys may also have it at `/srv/dressapp/` — the
docs use the new path).

## RAM budget

| Plan | vCPU | RAM | Backend (peak) | Caddy + frontend | Eyes (Q4_K_M, ~5 B) | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CX22  | 2 shared       | 4 GB  | ~1.4 GB | ~0.1 GB | ~4 GB resident | ❌ Will swap to disk; every `/predict` is 30 s+. |
| CX32  | 2 shared Intel | 8 GB  | ~1.4 GB | ~0.1 GB | ~4 GB resident | ✅ ~2 GB headroom. |
| **CPX32** | **4 dedicated AMD EPYC** | **8 GB** | **~1.4 GB** | **~0.1 GB** | **~4 GB resident** | ✅ **Recommended.** Same RAM as CX32 but ~2× the inference speed thanks to dedicated cores. |
| CX42  | 4 shared Intel | 16 GB | same    | same    | same | ✅ Future-proof for the Phase-2 mmproj (+1 GB) and bigger contexts. |

CPX32 (Hetzner's AMD line) is the sweet spot: 4 dedicated vCPUs let
us bump `LLAMA_THREADS=4` in `deploy/.env` for ~2× the throughput
you'd see on CX32's 2 shared cores. To take advantage:

```
EYES_LLAMA_THREADS=4
```

If you stay on a 4 GB-RAM CX22 instead, add a 4 GB swap file before
bringing up the Eyes service:

```bash
fallocate -l 4G /swapfile && chmod 600 /swapfile
mkswap /swapfile && swapon /swapfile
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' >> /etc/fstab
```

## One-time deploy

### 1. Pull latest code on the VPS

```bash
ssh root@<VPS_IP>
cd /srv/AI-Stylist                    # repo root — NOT /srv/AI-Stylist/deploy
git pull --ff-only origin main
```

If `git pull` reports `Already up to date.` but the
`inference-server/eyes/` directory or `eyes:` service in
`deploy/docker-compose.yml` is missing, the changes haven't landed on
GitHub yet — push from your dev environment first.

### 2. Place the GGUF artefacts on disk and add three keys to `deploy/.env`

The Eyes container reads its model file from a bind-mounted local
directory. Put your trained Q4 + mmproj artefacts there:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /srv/AI-Stylist/eyes_gguf
# scp your two GGUF files into that directory (from Google Drive or
# your local machine):
#   - gemma-4-e2b-it.Q4_K_M-002.gguf            (~3.4 GB main model)
#   - gemma-4-e2b-it.BF16-mmproj.gguf     (~986 MB vision projector, optional
#                                    until Phase 2 vision)
sudo chmod 644 /srv/AI-Stylist/eyes_gguf/*.gguf
ls -la /srv/AI-Stylist/eyes_gguf/
```

Then edit `deploy/.env` — append:

```bash
$EDITOR deploy/.env
```

```
# ---- DressApp Eyes (Phase O.3) -------------------------------------
# Switches the closet vision pipeline from Qwen-VL to the self-hosted
# fine-tuned Gemma-4 E2B running in the eyes container.
EYES_PROVIDER=gemma

# Shared secret between the backend container and the eyes container.
# Generate with:  openssl rand -hex 32
EYES_API_TOKEN=replace-with-32-bytes-of-hex

# CPX32 has 4 dedicated AMD vCPUs — use them all for inference.
# Default is 2 (sized for the 2-vCPU CX22/CX32 plans).
EYES_LLAMA_THREADS=4

# Optional: enables the LLaVA vision handler once mmproj is in place.
# Set to the basename of the mmproj file in /srv/AI-Stylist/eyes_gguf/.
EYES_MMPROJ_FILE=gemma-4-e2b-it.BF16-mmproj.gguf
```

> **No `EYES_HF_TOKEN`.** It is not in this list because DressApp does
> not download model artefacts from HuggingFace at runtime. Your GGUFs
> live at `/srv/AI-Stylist/eyes_gguf/`. The compose file bind-mounts
> that directory to `/models` inside the container, and the container
> loads the file from there.

### 3. Bring up the new service

ALL `docker compose` commands below MUST run from `/srv/AI-Stylist/`,
not from inside `deploy/`:

```bash
cd /srv/AI-Stylist
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --env-file deploy/.env \
  up -d --build eyes
```

First boot: clones llama.cpp HEAD + compiles `llama-server` + downloads
the 3.4 GB GGUF — budget **10–15 min** on the first run, then **~1 min**
for every restart afterward (compile layer cached, GGUF cached).

Why we build llama.cpp from source instead of using a Python wheel:
the fine-tune is `unsloth/gemma-4-e2b-it-unsloth-bnb-4bit` (Google
Gemma-4, April 2026). The GGUF is tagged with arch `gemma4`. Stock
`llama-cpp-python` wheels (latest 0.3.22) bundle a llama.cpp commit
from before the Gemma-4 loader merged (Unsloth's PR #21343), so they
reject the file with the opaque "Failed to load model from file"
error. Building llama.cpp from HEAD picks up the `gemma4` loader.

The container runs `llama-server` on the loopback (127.0.0.1:8080)
and FastAPI proxies our existing `/predict` shape onto its
OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions`. Backend's
`garment_vision._call_gemma_space` contract is unchanged.

Watch the build + boot:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml logs -f eyes
```

You should see, in order:

```
eyes  | downloading model: Yoram-Jacobs/dressapp-eyes-gguf/gemma-4-e2b-it.Q4_K_M-002.gguf
eyes  | downloaded /models/gemma-4-e2b-it.Q4_K_M-002.gguf (3.42 GB) in ~90s
eyes  | gguf metadata: {'general.architecture': 'gemma4', ...}
eyes  | spawning: /usr/local/bin/llama-server --model /models/...
eyes  | <llama-server's own log: model load, KV cache size, threads>
eyes  | ready: model=gemma-4-e2b-it.Q4_K_M-002.gguf vision=False
eyes  | INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:7860
```

If you ever see `Failed to load model from file` again, the metadata
line directly above tells you exactly which arch the GGUF claims —
match it against [llama.cpp's supported arch list](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp).

### 4. Restart the backend so it picks up the new env

```bash
cd /srv/AI-Stylist
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --env-file deploy/.env \
  up -d backend
```

The backend reads `EYES_PROVIDER`, `EYES_GEMMA_SPACE_URL`, and
`EYES_API_TOKEN` from `.env` at startup; existing items aren't
reanalysed, but every new `POST /api/v1/closet/analyze` (and the
`/reanalyze` button) now hits the local Eyes container instead of
Qwen-VL.

---

## Smoke test (run from `/srv/AI-Stylist/` on the VPS)

```bash
# 1. Health (no auth required)
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml exec backend \
  curl -fsS http://eyes:7860/healthz
# Expect: {"status":"ok","model":"gemma-4-e2b-it.Q4_K_M-002.gguf","vision_enabled":false,...}

# 2. Inference (auth required)
TOKEN=$(grep ^EYES_API_TOKEN= deploy/.env | cut -d= -f2-)
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml exec backend \
  curl -fsS -X POST http://eyes:7860/predict \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"Describe a navy blazer in JSON.","max_tokens":64,"json_mode":true}'
# Expect: {"output":"{\"category\":\"blazer\",...}","finish_reason":"stop",...}
```

## End-to-end test

Open the app, edit any closet item, click **Analyze**. The backend
should succeed (LLM call routed via the eyes container) and the
response latency will be ~3–8 s on CPX32's 4 dedicated cores
(roughly 2× faster than the same Q4_K_M on CX32). If it fails, the
backend's circuit breaker auto-falls-back to Qwen-VL — check
`docker compose logs backend | grep gemma` for any timeout/error
entries that triggered the fallback.

---

## Rotating the HF token

The HF token is only used for the **one-time GGUF download** on first
boot. Once `eyes-cache` has the file (verifiable with `docker volume
inspect dressapp_eyes-cache`), you can rotate or revoke the token at
any time without restarting anything. New tokens are only needed when:

- You push a new model file (`phase7-…gguf`) and want the next
  `docker compose up` to fetch it.
- You wipe the volume (`docker volume rm dressapp_eyes-cache`).

---

## Phase 2 — enable vision (mmproj)

When the vision projector exists in the model repo:

```
# add to deploy/.env
EYES_MMPROJ_FILE=gemma-4-e2b-it.BF16-mmproj.gguf
```

Then `docker compose up -d eyes`. The container detects the env var,
downloads the mmproj on next boot, and the FastAPI app auto-switches
to the `Llava15ChatHandler` — no other code change required.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Failed to load model from file: /models/...` | Wrong llama-cpp-python version. Confirm `requirements.txt` pins `0.3.19` or newer. Older versions don't know the Gemma-3/4 architecture. |
| `libc.musl-x86_64.so.1: cannot open shared object file` | The Dockerfile must compile llama-cpp-python from source (`pip install --no-binary llama-cpp-python …`). If you tweaked the Dockerfile to use the `--prefer-binary` flag, abetlen's wheel index ships Alpine/MUSL-built binaries that don't load on Debian. Revert to `--no-binary llama-cpp-python` and rebuild. |
| `eyes` container OOM-kills (exit 137) at startup | Not enough RAM. Add swap (see top of file) or upgrade the VPS plan. |
| `eyes` healthy, but backend logs `gemma fallback` | Either `EYES_API_TOKEN` mismatch (backend `.env` ≠ eyes `.env`) or the model is taking too long. Check `EYES_GEMMA_TIMEOUT_S` (default 60s). |
| `huggingface_hub.utils._errors.RepositoryNotFoundError: 401` | HF token revoked / wrong scope. Issue a fresh **Read** token scoped to `Yoram-Jacobs/dressapp-eyes-gguf`, paste into `deploy/.env`, and `docker compose up -d eyes`. |
| `truncated download or LFS pointer file` | Network blip during the 3.4 GB pull. Wipe the cache and retry: `docker compose down eyes && docker volume rm dressapp_eyes-cache && docker compose up -d eyes`. |
| Building llama-cpp-python from source (long compile, then OOM on smaller plans) | Expected on first build — that's the design. CPX32 (4 vCPU / 8 GB) builds it in ~5 min; CX22 (2 vCPU / 4 GB) needs swap or it will OOM during the compile. Lower `CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL` in the Dockerfile from 4 to 2 if you must build on the smaller plan. |
