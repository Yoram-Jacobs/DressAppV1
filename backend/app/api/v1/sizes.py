"""Size-chart analysis endpoint for the DressApp Chrome Extension.

Surface
-------
``POST /api/v1/sizes/analyze-chart`` accepts a cropped screenshot of
a size chart found on a third-party shopping site (plus optional
context: garment type, store, URL), combines it with the
authenticated user's stored ``body_measurements``, and returns a
structured size recommendation::

    {
        "recommended_size": "M",
        "confidence":       0.86,
        "garment_type":     "shirt",
        "size_chart_units": "cm",
        "matched_columns":  ["chest", "waist"],
        "reasoning":        "Your chest (95 cm) falls within size M ...",
        "alternatives":     [{"size":"L","fit":"looser"}],
        "source":           "gemini",
        "elapsed_ms":       2840,
    }

Pipeline (Phase 2 — screenshot-only)
------------------------------------
The extension sends a cropped JPEG of the size-chart region. We
forward that image to **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (the same multimodal
model the closet's ``GarmentVisionService`` uses when
``GARMENT_VISION_PROVIDER=gemini``) with a tight system prompt that
asks it to OCR the chart, match the user's body measurements
against the relevant columns, and return a structured JSON answer.

We deliberately **do not** call the self-hosted Gemma Space here —
Phase-1 Gemma runs in ``vision_disabled=true`` mode (no mmproj
file uploaded yet), so passing it an image-only payload always
yields an empty completion and a 30-60 s wall-clock penalty.
Routing straight to Gemini sidesteps that penalty entirely.

Optional ``chart_html`` / ``chart_text`` are still accepted for
back-compat and run a deterministic regex heuristic *before* the
vision call when the extension happened to capture a clean HTML
``<table>`` (instant, free win). When neither resolves the chart,
the response surfaces a helpful retry message.

Privacy
-------
The screenshot is sent to Gemini for OCR and discarded. The user's
measurements are sent in the system prompt context. We do not
persist the request; this is a transient consult, not a logged
interaction.

_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You read clothing size charts from images and recommend ONE size.

INPUT
-----
* An IMAGE of a size chart (a table with size labels and numbers).
* The USER'S BODY MEASUREMENTS in centimeters (e.g. chest, waist, hips, shoulders, height).
* Possibly the USER'S CLOTHING SIZES they normally buy (``shirt_size``, ``pants_size``, ``shoe_size``).
* Optional context: garment type, store name, page title.

WHAT TO DO
----------
1. OCR the size chart in the image. Extract:
   - The column headers (e.g. "Bust", "Chest", "Waist", "Hip", "Shoulder", "Length", "Sleeve", "Bottom").
   - The units (cm, in, or both).
   - The size labels in the first column (S/M/L/EU 38/...).
   - The numeric value(s) in each cell. Cells may hold a single number (a garment dimension) OR a range like "86-90" (a body-measurement bracket).
2. The user's measurements have been **pre-expanded server-side** so every common chart-column synonym is already populated. For example ``chest`` and ``bust`` carry the same value; ``shoulder``, ``shoulders`` and ``shoulder_width`` carry the same value; ``hip``, ``hips``, ``bottom`` and ``bottom_hem`` carry the same value. Do a case-insensitive substring match between each chart column header and the JSON keys to find the user's value for that column. **NEVER** answer "measurements were not provided" if any column header matches any JSON key.
3. For each row, check whether every relevant user measurement fits — but apply the right rule for the **kind** of measurement:

   * **CIRCUMFERENCE columns** (Bust / Chest / Waist / Hip / Bottom / Shoulder Width / Neck / Thigh) — the garment must be at least as wide as the user.
       - Range cell "lo-hi": user value must satisfy ``lo <= v <= hi``.
       - Single-number cell (a garment dimension): user value must be ``<=`` the cell value.
   * **LENGTH columns** (Length / Body Length / Sleeve Length / Inseam / Outseam / Total Length / Arm Length) — the user value is treated as their **full-size MAX** (full-arm length, full-leg length, full-torso length). A garment that is **shorter** than this max is perfectly fine — it just means the garment is short-sleeved / cropped / mini-length / etc. So:
       - Range cell "lo-hi": user value must satisfy ``v >= lo`` only (no upper bound — short garments are fine).
       - Single-number cell: the garment's value must be ``<=`` the user's value (i.e. the garment is not LONGER than the user's body part). If the garment is dramatically shorter (e.g. 19 cm sleeve vs user's 46 cm full-arm length), it's a deliberately short-sleeved garment, **NOT** a misfit and **NOT** an anomaly. Note this in ``reasoning`` ("this is a short-sleeve top") but do not flag it.

   Pick the SMALLEST size where every relevant CIRCUMFERENCE column fits.

4. **Tie-break: when the user's value is within 0.5 cm of the upper bound of the chosen size, pick the next size UP** (loose is wearable, tight is not). Surface the smaller size as an alternative with `fit: "snug"`. Tie-breaking applies to circumferences only — length-column tiebreaks favour the user's reach (longer is fine, shorter is also fine).
5. If the chart is in inches, convert mentally (1 in = 2.54 cm) and report units accordingly.

ANOMALY DETECTION (always run before picking the size)
--------------------------------------------------------
Users sometimes mistype their measurements. Before applying the body-circumference rule, compare each provided body **circumference** value to the corresponding chart column's range:

- **ONLY check circumference columns** (chest, bust, waist, hip, shoulders, neck, thigh). Length columns (sleeve, inseam, outseam, length, arm_length) ARE NEVER ANOMALY-FLAGGED for being "too high" — the user's stored sleeve / inseam / outseam represent their full-body MAX (full arm / full leg / full torso length) and are *expected* to exceed any short-sleeve, cropped, or mini garment. Only flag a length value if it is implausibly **low** (e.g. ``sleeve: 2 cm`` — clearly a typo).
- For circumferences: trigger a flag in EITHER of these cases:
    (a) the user's value exceeds the chart's column **maximum** AT ALL (even a small margin) — no size in this chart can actually accommodate them, so the value is suspect; OR
    (b) the user's value is below the chart's column minimum by more than **15%** (clearly far smaller than any size offered).
  When triggered:
    1. **Skip that measurement** when picking the recommended size — do NOT let one obviously-wrong value veto a perfectly good fit on the other columns.
    2. **Drop that column from ``matched_columns``**.
    3. **Append a short, friendly warning to ``warnings``** in this exact shape:
       ``"Your <field> (<value> cm) looks higher/lower than expected for this kind of garment. Please re-measure — DressApp ignored it for this recommendation."``
- If, after skipping anomalies, you still have at least one usable body circumference, use it. Otherwise fall through to the CLOTHING-SIZE FALLBACK rule.
- ``height`` and ``weight`` are never anomaly-checked against the chart (they're not garment dimensions).

Examples of what this rule catches:
* User stored ``shoulders: 55 cm`` and the chart maxes at ``50 cm`` (4XL) — exceeds the chart range, so no size fits → **flag + skip + warn**.
* User stored ``shoulders: 75 cm`` (likely typed in inches) and the chart maxes at ``50 cm`` — exceeds, **definite anomaly**: skip + warn.
* User stored ``waist: 12 cm`` (likely missing a digit) — far below any plausible chart minimum, skip + warn.

Examples that are NOT anomalies and must NEVER be flagged:
* User stored ``sleeve: 65 cm`` (a real full-arm length); the chart shows ``Sleeve Length: 19 cm`` (a short-sleeve T-shirt). The garment is just short-sleeved — pick the size based on bust/shoulder, mention "short-sleeve" in the reasoning. **No warning.**
* User stored ``inseam: 80 cm``; the chart shows ``Inseam: 25 cm`` (shorts). It's just shorts. **No warning.**
* User stored ``outseam: 110 cm``; the chart shows ``Length: 60 cm`` (a mini dress). It's a short garment. **No warning.**

CLOTHING-SIZE FALLBACK (apply when body circumferences are missing)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
If the user has NO usable body circumferences for the columns shown (e.g. only ``height``, ``weight``, ``shirt_size``, ``pants_size``, ``shoe_size`` are filled in), DO NOT give up. Use these signals instead:

- ``shirt_size`` is authoritative for tops / shirts / jackets / dresses (where the chart shows Bust / Chest / Shoulder / Sleeve / Length). If the chart's first column lists labels like S, M, L, XL — pick the row whose label matches ``shirt_size`` (case-insensitive). If the chart uses EU/numeric labels (38, 40, 50, 52...), translate the user's letter size using the standard mapping: XS≈34/44, S≈36/46, M≈38/48, L≈40/50, XL≈42/52, XXL≈44/54, XXXL≈46/56. Adjust by ±1 if the store is known to run small/large.
- ``pants_size`` is authoritative for trousers / shorts / jeans / skirts (where the chart shows Waist / Hip / Inseam). Match the numeric value or letter against the size column.
- ``shoe_size`` is authoritative for footwear charts.
- ``height`` and ``weight`` alone are NEVER sufficient — but if combined with ``shirt_size`` or ``pants_size`` they confirm the choice. If ONLY ``height``/``weight`` are present, you may still produce a low-confidence (≤0.4) recommendation by mapping height to a size band (e.g., 170-178cm + average build → M).

When using the clothing-size fallback, set ``confidence`` between 0.55 and 0.80 (lower than a real measurement match), set ``matched_columns`` to ``["shirt_size"]`` (or pants/shoe), and explain in ``reasoning`` that the recommendation is based on the user's usual size, suggesting they add body measurements for a tighter fit.

OUTPUT
------
Return ONLY this JSON object. No prose, no markdown, no backticks.

{
  "recommended_size": "<chart label, e.g. 'M' or 'EU 38'>",
  "confidence": <float 0..1>,
  "garment_type": "<lowercase noun, your best guess>",
  "size_chart_units": "cm" | "in" | "mixed" | "unknown",
  "matched_columns": ["chest", "waist", ...],
  "reasoning": "<one short paragraph, 1-3 sentences>",
  "alternatives": [{"size":"S","fit":"snug"}, {"size":"L","fit":"loose"}],
  "warnings": ["Your shoulders (75 cm) looks higher than expected ...", ...]
}

ONLY return ``recommended_size: null`` if BOTH of these are true:
  (a) the image really doesn't contain a usable size chart (only product photos, occluded, blurry), AND
  (b) the user has no usable size signal at all (no body circumferences AND no shirt/pants/shoe size).
In every other case you MUST return a best-effort size with appropriate confidence.
