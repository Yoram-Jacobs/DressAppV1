"""Wardrobe Reconstructor (Phase Q).

Takes a potentially-bad garment crop (from the multi-item extractor or a
single upload) and decides whether it needs reconstruction. When it does,
we use **Nano Banana** (`gemini-2.5-flash-image`, native Google SDK,
requires ``GEMINI_API_KEY``). The earlier HF FLUX.1-schnell fallback was
removed in May 2026 along with the rest of the HF runtime surface — if
the direct Gemini key is absent, reconstruction returns ``None`` so the
caller keeps the original crop.

Public API
----------
* ``should_reconstruct(analysis, bbox, frame_size) -> (bool, list[str])``
  Fast, local heuristics. Returns ``(needs_repair, reasons)``.
* ``reconstruct(crop_bytes, analysis, *, validate=True) -> dict | None``
  Runs the reconstructor with a composed prompt and (optionally)
  sanity-checks the output by re-analysing the generated image. Returns
  ``{image_b64, mime_type, prompt, validated, rejected_reason}`` or
  ``None`` on unrecoverable failure.

All calls soft-fail so the upstream analyse pipeline never errors because
of a reconstruction hiccup.
