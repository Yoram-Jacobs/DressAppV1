"""Heavy-model warmup orchestrator (Patch M13 — May 2026).

Why this module exists
----------------------
The three heavy CV models that gate the `/api/v1/closet/analyze`
pipeline — SegFormer (clothing parser), rembg (background matte), and
FashionCLIP (faithfulness guard) — were each individually lazy-loaded
on their first invocation. On a cold backend, that meant the FIRST
user upload paid the cumulative model-init cost:

    SegFormer ~5-8s + rembg ~1-3s + CLIP ~3-8s = 9-19s of cold tax

…ON TOP of Gemini detection + per-crop Gemini analysis. The Kubernetes
ingress front of the preview / Emergent pods has a hard 60 s upstream
timeout. Combined with a 4K outfit upload of an outfit with 5+ items
that's analysed per-crop, the cold-start total regularly exceeded the
ceiling and the ingress returned **502 Bad Gateway** to the browser.
The user retried, models were now warm, second attempt succeeded —
which is exactly the "Analysis failed on first attempt, works on
retry" UX bug filed as Issue 3.

Strategy
--------
Fire-and-forget asyncio task from the FastAPI startup hook. The task:

  1. Doesn't block app startup (supervisor / k8s readiness probe stays
     happy — backend reports ready in <3 s as before).
  2. Loads SegFormer + rembg + CLIP **in parallel** (each on its own
     worker thread via ``asyncio.to_thread``) so the warm-up wall time
     is ``max(load_segformer, load_rembg, load_clip)`` rather than
     their sum. On the dev pod the parallel total clocks ~6 s versus
     ~14 s serial.
  3. Re-uses the existing lazy-singleton locks inside each service, so
     if a real user request races the warmup, neither side double-
     loads — both threads block on the same shared lock and the first
     one to win publishes the singleton.

Kill switch
-----------
``settings.WARMUP_MODELS_ON_STARTUP`` (env var of the same name).
Default ``true`` when the local-ML stack is enabled, ``false`` on
lightweight deploys (LIGHTWEIGHT_DEPLOY=true) where the pod can't
afford to preload these models at all (250m CPU / 1Gi RAM Emergent
host pod). The lightweight path uses the Gemini-only detect path so
SegFormer/rembg/CLIP are never actually needed.
