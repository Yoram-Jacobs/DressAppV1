"""
Phase Z2 — perceptual image hashing helpers.

Used by /closet/preflight to detect duplicate uploads even when:
  * the existing item's "original_image_url" was never stored (legacy
    items keep only a thumbnail / segmented preview);
  * the user re-exports their photo at a different JPEG quality;
  * the user takes a slightly different shot of the same garment
    (similar angle, similar lighting).

Implementation: a 64-bit average-hash (aHash) PLUS a small RGB colour
signature so two same-shape garments of *different colours* (e.g. navy
shorts vs grey shorts) are NOT flagged as duplicates. Cheap (~3 ms per
image on a typical pod), no extra dependencies — only Pillow + numpy,
both already in requirements.txt.

Match decision:
  * Hamming distance ≤ 6 bits on the shape hash, AND
  * Manhattan distance ≤ ``DEFAULT_COLOR_THRESHOLD`` on the colour
    signature (sum of |Δr| + |Δg| + |Δb| over the 4 quadrants,
    each channel 0–255 = max 4 × 255 × 3 = 3060).
