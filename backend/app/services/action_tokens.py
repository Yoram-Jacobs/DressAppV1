"""Action tokens — short-lived JWTs embedded in transactional email links.

Used by Wave 2 marketplace flows (swap accept/deny, donate accept/deny)
so a recipient can act on a transaction directly from their inbox
without logging in. Security model:

* Tokens are signed with the same ``JWT_SECRET`` as auth tokens but use
  a dedicated ``aud`` claim (``"dressapp.tx_action"``) so they can never
  be confused with — or replayed against — bearer auth endpoints.
* Each token carries a random ``jti`` (UUID4) that the issuing endpoint
  persists on the transaction (e.g. ``swap.action_token_jti``). When the
  recipient clicks accept/deny, the action endpoint compares the
  presented ``jti`` against the persisted one and refuses if they
  don't match — that is, every email rotation invalidates older links,
  and a single token can only be spent once before being marked used.
* Default expiry is **24 hours**; emails mention a 7-day window so the
  caller can override per-flow if a future product decision wants
  longer-lived links.

Usage::

    from app.services import action_tokens
    token = action_tokens.mint(
        tx_id=tx.id, role="lister", decision_choices=("accept", "deny")
    )
    # → URL: f"{APP_PUBLIC_URL}/api/v1/transactions/action?token={token}&decision=accept"

    payload = action_tokens.verify(presented_token, expected_decision="accept")
    # → {"tx_id": ..., "role": ..., "jti": ..., "decision_choices": [...]}
