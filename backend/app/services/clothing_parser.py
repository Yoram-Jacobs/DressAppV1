"""Clothing parser — per-class semantic segmentation for garments.

Phase V (Fix round 2 — April 2026):
HF serverless `api-inference.huggingface.co` has been retired and the new
`router.huggingface.co/hf-inference` provider does not support custom
community models like `sayeed99/segformer_b3_clothes`. We now run the
model locally via `transformers` on CPU — one-time ~180 MB download,
cached in-process. First call warms the model (≈5 s on this pod),
subsequent calls are ≈2-4 s per image.

Execution order (first hit wins):
  1. Self-hosted endpoint (`CLOTHING_PARSER_ENDPOINT_URL`) — future
     `dressapp.co` GPU box; contract: POST multipart `image` → JSON
     `{segments: [{label, mask (PNG b64), bbox[y,x,y,x 0-1000]?}, ...]}`.
  2. Local transformers + torch CPU (primary).

The function never raises on bad inputs — returns `[]` so the caller
(garment_vision) can fall back to the Gemini detector.

Bounding-box convention: `[ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax]` on a 0..1000 scale
(matches the rest of the pipeline / `_crop_to_bbox`). A `mask` field
(full-size numpy uint8 binary) is also returned so callers can build
alpha-cutout crops rather than raw bbox crops.

    Detects whether a unified ``Shoes`` mask is anatomically asymmetric
    (one half of the frame carries < 30 % the mass of the other), and
    if so re-runs SegFormer on the *missing* half of the source image
    to look for the partner boot the first pass missed.

    Fidelity rule
    -------------
    If the second pass also returns nothing in the missing half (e.g.
    the photo is a profile shot, or the partner shoe is occluded by an
    object or the model's pose), the function returns the original
    mask unchanged. We never fabricate a partner the source photo
    doesn't show — staying loyal to the user's upload is explicitly
    required by product spec.

    Why a second SegFormer pass is needed
    -------------------------------------
    SegFormer's per-pixel argmax has a strong global prior: if one
    boot dominates the lower-frame footwear region, the model can
    under-confidently classify the partner boot as "Right-leg" /
    "Skin" / background. Cropping to a half-frame removes that prior
    and forces the model to reconsider; on a clean photo with two
    boots, the second pass routinely recovers the missed partner.

    Cost
    ----
    ~2-4 s of CPU inference per asymmetric footwear detection. Fires
    on a small fraction of uploads (only when symmetry is broken).
    No-op on photos where both boots were detected cleanly.

    Removes / merges per-label detections that occupy substantially the

    Two cases this fixes
    --------------------
    1. **Phantom-inside-real** (e.g. long coat fires both ``Upper-clothes``
       and ``Dress`` — the tight Upper-clothes mask sits entirely inside
       the looser Dress mask). Containment-of-smaller-in-larger ≥
       ``_NMS_CONTAINMENT_THRESHOLD`` → drop the smaller.

    2. **Split-by-shadow** (e.g. trousers fire ``Pants`` on the upper
       half and ``Skirt`` on the lower half because a shadow band
       confused the per-pixel classifier). IoU is low but containment
       on the smaller half is also low — instead this is caught by
       same-category masks that *don't* overlap much being unioned
       (see below).

    Algorithm
    ---------
    * Sort garment-class entries (top / bottom / dress) by descending
      mask area.
    * For each smaller entry, compare against every larger entry kept
      so far:
        - If ``containment ≥ 0.70`` OR ``IoU ≥ 0.50``:
            - **Same category** → union the smaller mask into the
              larger and drop the smaller (handles "Pants" + "Skirt"
              both = "bottom" overlapping a single trouser).
            - **Different category** → drop the smaller (handles
              "Upper-clothes" inside "Dress").

    Accessories, footwear, and headwear are passed through untouched.

    """Refine a rembg-matted PNG by AND-ing its alpha with a SegFormer mask.

    Why: rembg gives crisp, accurate edges around the foreground but treats
    the entire foreground as one object. On a multi-garment outfit photo
    rembg might preserve both shirt + pants in a single crop. The
    SegFormer mask says which pixels belong specifically to the targeted
    garment class, so intersecting the two yields a clean cutout of just
    the targeted item.

    Human-mask subtraction (optional, recommended)
    ----------------------------------------------
    When ``human_mask`` is provided (binary uint8, same H×W as the
    crop OR full-res — automatically resized), pixels marked as the
    wearer's BODY (Face / Hair / Left-arm / Right-arm / Left-leg /
    Right-leg from SegFormer's ATR classes) are subtracted from the
    DILATED garment soft-mask BEFORE the rembg intersection. This
    closes a structural leak: rembg's person-shaped foreground keeps
    every skin pixel, and the dilation pass (which legitimately grows
    the garment mask outward to recover puffy sleeves / shoe halos)
    grows it into adjacent face / neck / arm / leg regions. Without
    explicit skin subtraction, a shirt card inherits the model's
    neck and chin, a skirt card inherits the upper thighs, etc.
    The subtraction is applied AFTER dilation so dilation can still
    recover legitimate garment halo on the non-skin side; only
    pixels that are BOTH (dilated-garment) AND (skin) get wiped.

    Patch 12f (May 2026) — DILATE the SegFormer mask before blending.
    Earlier behaviour used a strict ``min(rembg, gaussian_blur(mask))``,
    which deleted any pixel SegFormer didn't mark — even pixels rembg
    correctly identified as foreground. Two visible failure modes:
      * A billowy-cuff blouse: SegFormer's ``Upper-clothes`` mask covers
        the body but misses the puffy sleeve halo → sleeve pixels rembg
        kept get wiped → fragmented "torn fabric" thumbnail.
      * Burgundy sneakers on cobblestones: SegFormer's ``Shoes`` mask is
        patchy because shoe-vs-pavement contrast is low → real shoe
        pixels get wiped → smudgy blob thumbnail.
    Dilating the mask by ``DILATE_PCT`` of the crop's short edge (clamped
    to a sensible min/max) gives the intersection enough slack to admit
    rembg's correct foreground pixels in the halo region — while still
    relying on rembg's verdict as the upper bound, so background junk
    that rembg correctly rejects stays rejected.

    Patch 12i (May 2026) — per-category dilation budget. The flat 2.5%
    of Patch 12f was tuned for free-edge garments (footwear, hats —
    where the SegFormer mask is often patchy and there is no adjacent
    garment to leak into). On tight torso crops where a blouse and a
    skirt share the waistline, 2.5% (= 25 px on a 1000 px crop)
    extended each garment's mask 25 px into the other's region. With
    rembg keeping both garments as foreground, the blouse cutout
    inherited a 25 px rim of skirt fabric at its bottom edge (and vice
    versa). Visible as a coloured strip in the closet thumbnail.

    The fix splits the budget by ``category``:

    +----------------+---------+--------------------------------------+
    | Category       | DilPct  | Reason                               |

    | top / Top      | 1.5 %   | shares waistline with bottom/dress;  |

    |                |         | bleed at the hem. Still recovers     |
    |                |         | most puffy sleeves on 800-1500 px    |
    |                |         | crops (1.5 % = 12-22 px).            |
    +----------------+---------+--------------------------------------+
    | bottom / Bottom| 1.5 %   | symmetric — shares waistline with    |
    |                |         | top/dress.                           |
    +----------------+---------+--------------------------------------+
    | dress /        | 1.8 %   | top edge tight (neckline near        |
    | full body      |         | jacket lapels); bottom edge free     |
    |                |         | (hem). Slightly looser than          |

    |                |         | skirt shapes.                        |
    +----------------+---------+--------------------------------------+
    | accessory      | 1.5 %   | belts share waistline; scarves       |

    |                |         | err on tight to avoid bleed.         |
    +----------------+---------+--------------------------------------+
    | outerwear      | 2.0 %   | jackets/coats over t-shirts: collar  |
    |                |         | shares neckline with top, hem        |
    |                |         | usually free. Middle ground.         |
    +----------------+---------+--------------------------------------+

    +----------------+---------+--------------------------------------+
    | headwear       | 2.5 %   | UNCHANGED — hats have free top edge  |
    |                |         | and the hair/brim transition needs   |
